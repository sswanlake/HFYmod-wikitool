# HFYmod-wikitool
A tool for Reddit's r/HFY wiki Mods

This script makes it easier to create an r/HFY wiki page by compiling a list of an author's OC/PI stories, and displaying that list in a window. 
It's also generally useful because it basically displays a complete wikipage/user history (on r/HFY that is).

# Things this script does:
 - adds a button under author's username on posts
 - when the button is clicked, it pops up a modal "window"
 - in this window, it displays the author's name, a link to their wiki page (created or not), and a markdown of what the contents of their wiki page should look like (all links flaired as "OC" "PI" or unflaired in /r/HFY)
 - all of the names of the posts are also links to them
 - hovering over the names will tell you the date the post was created and the current score
 - in a separate section there is a similar list containing Meta/Misc/Video/Text submissionso)
 - clicking inside any of the gray-ish blue areas will select the entire contents of that section (for easy copying)
 - clicking the "hide" button above a gray-ish blue section will hide that specific area
 - it does NOT serparate series from one-shots on it's own
  - you can pull out posts with a series name in the title by typing the series name in the text area then hitting enter. All of those posts will be pulled and compiled into a series page
 - all series linked on the author's page are listed out (with a handy count beside them)

# How to use:
Just install it and click the button! If there's a series, type the name into the text area then hit enter.
