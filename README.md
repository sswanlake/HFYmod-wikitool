# HFYmod-wikitool
A tool for Reddit's r/HFY wiki Mods

This script makes it easier to create an r/HFY wiki page by compiling a list of an author's OC/PI stories, and displaying that list in a window. 
It's also generally useful because it basically displays a complete wikipage/user history.

# Things this script does:
- adds a button under author's username on posts
- when the button is clicked, it pops up a modal "window"
- in this window, it displays the author's name, a link to their wiki page (created or not), and a markdown of what the contents of their wiki page should look like (all links flaired as "OC" "PI" or unflaired in /r/HFY)
 - only the  first 100 submissions are loaded when the window first opens. you must click the "load" buttton in the window to load more (this only really applies to long-time writers like /u/RegalLegalEagle and /u/someguynamedted)
 - it does NOT serparate series from one-shots
 - all of the names of the posts are also links to them
 - hovering over the names will tell you the date the post was created and the current score
- in a separate section there is a similar list containing Meta/Misc/Video/Text submissionso)

# How to use:
Just install it and click the button! (...then click "load" if you need to)
